<h1>Trophy Hunting</h1>
<article>
<p>
Trophy hunting is the selective hunting of wild game classified as game animals. The primary motivation is to seek the oldest, and most mature animal from a given population, which is typically a male with the largest body size or largest antlers or horns. These animals have made their contribution to the gene pool and are nearing or are post-breeding age. 
</p>
<p>
Another motivation for the hunter may be the opportunity to participate in the management of a population by selectively removing these post breeding-age males. Parts of the animal may be kept as a hunting trophy or memorial (usually the skin, antlers, horns and/or head), the carcass itself is often used as food.
</p>
<p>
Trophy hunting has firm supporters and opponents. Public debate about trophy hunting often centers on the question of the morality of recreational hunting or the extent to which the money paid by sportsmen seeking a trophy animal provides a conservation benefit to the overall population of game animals and the rural economies where the game is hunted.
</p>
<p>
Misconceptions exist that trophy hunters just keep the head as their trophy and leave the meat of the animal to waste. It is against the law in most counties to waste legally harvested game, or any game meat that is suitable for human consumption. Hunters who do not bring the meat home from their hunts often donate to local people, or food banks such as Hunters Feeding The Hungry. Trophy hunting should not be confused with poaching, the practice of taking game illegally.

<h3 id="section1">Big game hunting</h3>
<p>
A big-game hunter is a person engaged in the sport of trophy hunting for large animals or game. Potential big game sought include, but are not limited to, bears, big cats, hippos, elephants, rhinos, buffalos, moose and so forth.
</p>
<p>
Tanzania has an estimated 40% of the population of lion (Panthera leo). Its wildlife authorities defend their success in keeping such numbers (as compared to countries like Kenya, where lion numbers have plummeted dramatically) as linked to the use of trophy hunting as a conservation tool. According to Alexander N. Songorwa, director of wildlife for the Tanzanian Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism, trophy hunting generated roughly $75 million for Tanzania’s economy from 2008 to 2011.
</p>
<p>
According to a 2012 article by P. Lindsey and G. Balme, if lion hunting was effectively precluded, trophy hunting could potentially become financially unviable across at least 59,538 km2 that could result in a concomitant loss of habitat. However, the loss of lion hunting could have other potentially broader negative impacts including reduction of competitiveness of wildlife-based land uses relative to ecologically unfavourable alternatives. Restrictions on lion hunting may also reduce tolerance for the species among communities where local people benefit from trophy hunting, and may reduce funds available for anti-poaching.
</p>

<h3 id="section2">Ranch hunting</h3>
<p>
Many species of game such as the Indian blackbuck, nilgai, axis deer and barasingha, the Iranian red sheep, and variety of other species of deer, sheep, and antelope from Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands were introduced to ranches in Texas and Florida for the sake of trophy hunting. These animals are typically hunted on a fee for each kill, with hunters paying $4000 or more to be able to hunt exotic game.
<p>
As many of these species are endangered or threatened in their native habitat, the United States' government requires 10% of the hunting fee to be given to conservation efforts in the areas where these animals are indigenous.
</p>
<p>
 Hunting of endangered animals in the United States is normally illegal under the Endangered Species Act, but is permitted on these ranches since the rare animals hunted there are not indigenous to the United States to begin with. The Humane Society of the United States has criticized these ranches and the people who hunt there for among other reasons that they are still hunting endangered animals even if the animals were raised specifically to be hunted.
</p>
<p>
Wildlife ranches dedicated to sustainable hunting have proliferated greatly in some countries of Africa, notably, Namibia and South Africa. Wildlife has seen gigantic growth on private land in Southern Africa in the last three decades. It evolved from a mere cost, which was better eradicated to a great economic asset, once private ranchers were granted the rights of ownership over game.[6] Wildlife ranches have contributed greatly to the South African economy, mostly through sustainable utilisitation of game as trophy animals.
</p>

<h3 id="section3">Trophy hunting in Africa</h3>
<p>
Trophy hunting has been practiced in Africa and is still a practiced conservation policy in many African countries. According to a study sponsored by CIC in partnership with FAO, the revenue generated by hunting tourism in seven SADC countries in 2008 is approximately US$190million.
</p>
<p>
In an opinion piece by Jeff Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, he states that "despite the wild claims that trophy hunting brings millions of dollars in revenue to local people in otherwise poor communities, there is no proof of this. Even pro-hunting organizations like the International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation have reported that only 3 percent of revenue from trophy hunting ever makes it to the communities affected by hunting. 
</p>
<p>
The rest goes to national governments or foreign-based outfitters. The money that does come into Africa from hunting pales in comparison to the billions and billions generated from tourists who come just to watch wildlife. If lions and other animals continue to disappear from Africa, this vital source of income—nonconsumptive tourism—will end, adversely impacting people all over Africa."
</p>
<p>
However, South African Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, contradicts Flocken's conclusions by stating that the hunting industry has contributed millions to South Africa's economy in past years. In the 2010 hunting season, total revenue of approximately R1.1-billion was generated by the local and trophy hunting industries collectively.
</p>
<p>
"This amount only reflects the revenue generated through accommodation and species fees. The true revenue is therefore substantially higher, as this amount does not even include revenue generated through the associated industries as a result of the multiplier effect," according to Molewa.
</p>
<p>
Botswana banned trophy hunting in 2014, and now villagers claim they get no income from trophy hunters, and suffer from damage from elephants and buffaloes damaging their food crop fields and lions killing their livestock.[11] Conservationists claim trophy hunting is more effective for wildlife management than a complete hunting ban.[12]
